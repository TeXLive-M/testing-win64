               How to install 64bit binaries for TeX Live on Windows


In the following, $INSTALLDIR is $SELFAUTOPARENT in the TeX Live,
that is, the parent directory of "texmf-dist".

(1) Expand the file tl-win64.zip in $INSTALLDIR,

(2) After expanding tl-win64.zip in $INSTALLDIR,
    change related command PATH from
    $INSTALLDIR\bin\win32
    to
    $INSTALLDIR\bin\win64;$INSTALLDIR\bin\win32

    Note that the following 32bit binaries in $INSTALLDIR\bin\win32
    are still used on WOW64:

    jbig2.exe       xindy-lisp.exe  xindy.mem       unzip.exe   zip.exe
    gzip.exe        gunzip.exe

    bitmap2eps.exe  biber.exe       dviout.exe      psv.exe
    texdoctk.exe    texworks.exe    tlmgr-gui.exe.

    Moreover, tlmgr.bat does not exist in $INSTALLDIR\bin\win64 due to an
    obvious reason.

    Thus $INSTALLDIR\bin\win32 is necessary "after" $INSTALLDIR\bin\win64.

    If there are problems in 64bit binaries, it is easy to recover
    the original TeX Live win32, by changing back the PATH:
    $INSTALLDIR\bin\win64;$INSTALLDIR\bin\win32 --->
    $INSTALLDIR\bin\win32

(3) Ghostscript is assumed to be 64bit. Therefore users should install
    64bit Ghostscript and set the command PATH for the Ghostscript.
    However, don't define TEXLIVE_WINDOWS_EXTERNAL_GS in texmf.cnf,
    because the preinstalled 32bit Ghostscript is also used in several cases.

    The 64bit binaries are made with the latest sources. Therefore several
    TeX engines may not be compatible with the present TeX Live. Thus users
    should run the command
    fmtutil-sys --all
